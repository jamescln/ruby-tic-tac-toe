# ruby-tic-tac-toe

This is a project to build a tic-tac-toe style game to be played in the command line between two players.

This project will help me become more comfortable working with classes and objects. It will also develop my understanding of OOP theory and state management.

**Outline**

    -Make a board class and a player class.
    -Make a model for holding board information using nested array.
    -Create two player instances (named by the users) and a board instance.
    -Create a game loop that takes a player input, places it into the array, then checks to see if either player has won.
